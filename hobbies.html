        <h1>What are my hobbies?</h1>
        <p>Well im a typical nerd. Technology is basically my life, a walking zombie on the phone. No I'm not that bad...anyways. Besides coding and programming I do have hobbies. You could either catch me reading either actual books or mangas and webtoons. Avid anime fan but more on the reading side of it. I also love playing board games sucha as Betraly at House on the Hill, Arkham Horror LCG and many many more. Down to play any and all board games! I also play a lot of different TCG's but my main one is Magic the Gathering, mostly the format of commander/EDH. Of course I love my RPG's, JRPG's turn-based games and gacha mobile games. Constaly thinking what my next move will be to get the upper hand on my opponents, makes me think, theorize and experiment. Mostly ending in failure but eventually it works out! My favorite game would be Baldur's Gate 3 and Persona 5.</p>
