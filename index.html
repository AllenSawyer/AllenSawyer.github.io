        <h1>About me:</h1>
        <p>Hello my name is Allen. After trying a few different jobs I decided to get my GED and go to college. Why did
            I decide to do this? I was looking for something I would enjoy for the rest of my life. What did I choose?
            Well on October, 2022 I decided to go down the Computer Information Science route and get my degree at OTC.
            Back in high-school I took website development I and II and enjoyed it. Then I did a little bit of Java and
            fell in love even more with coding. Its like a never ending puzzle that can constantly be upgraded and never
            an ending in sight for it as there is always something to do to make it easier or simpler. And that sounds
            right up my alley! I'm excited to be going down this road and see where it will take me in life. Then
            starting January 2023 here I am!</p>

        <h1>What have I learned so far:</h1>
        <p>So far (As of December 2023) I've taken Cloud Fundementals I using AWS, Web Site Development I learning to
            use HTML and CSS, lastly Intro to Programming where I learned basic C#, but I will be learning more soon!
            For more Information look at the Classes tab!</p>

        <h1>When this was made:</h1>
        <p>So I am making this on 12/11/2023 as part of the last assignments for Web Site Development I in college. I
            will post updates on this whenever I can tho.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 10px; float: right;">I'm not good at design tho currently...what colors go good and such,
            yucky but I like these colors...</p><br><br>
