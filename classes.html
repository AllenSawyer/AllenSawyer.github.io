            <td><b>Cloud Fundementals I</b></td>
            <td>This class was about learning the basics of Cloud using AWS services. We learned how to use different AWS tools such as EC2, S3, and more.</td>
            <td>Sadly there wasn't a lot of individual stuff to do as most of the stuff you have to pay for so we were locked behind labs.But from what I did I enjoyed it, but I think I took it to early as in all honesty I didn't fully understand it.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Web Site Development I</b></td>
            <td>This class we learned how to make websites using HTML and CSS. First using Notepad++ to learn the dreadful way of no help when making a website. Then we moved onto working with Visual Studio Code, which compared to Notepad++ is like a God send. Coding is easier and just as fun as theres so much you can use to enhance the experience. Afterwards we learned more stuff ranging from margin and padding, to media querries and flexboxes.</td>
            <td>Stuff I was proud of was probably the activity where we had to make a website about a business and I did mine over the job I had at the time. Despite it being early and not having a lot of tools on me I was proud of it and how it turned out. Despite now looking back and seeing how I could've made it better. Despite all that I loved it.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Intro to Computer Programming</b></td>
            <td>This class was an introduction to programming. We learned the bare minimum of C#, didn't do much until the very end of the semester. We first started with using Microsoft MakeCode Arcade to see how coding works in block form. Then we started using C# to run simple programs like "Hello World" and slowly evolving to coin flips, counting down from 100 bottles of milk on the wall and using correct wording when it reached 2 bottles of milk, one bottle of milk, and no more bottles of milk.</td>
            <td>My favorite thing I did was my final project where I made a Text-Based Adventure where you tell it your name, choose a weapon and fight an enemy. The thing I was most proud of figuring out was assigning values to the weapons and having it deal random damage between the values. Such as a Sword being able to deal damage anywhere from 5 to 20. Now it's not the prettiest thing because I had big ambitions but not all of it came to fruition and there is some left over code when I had to make it usable to submit and some code that did nothing. But on my own time I play on upgrading it.</td>
